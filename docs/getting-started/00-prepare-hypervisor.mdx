# Recommended Hardware

The recommended hardware for the server is as follows:

- **CPU**: 6-8 cores
- **RAM**: >=16 GB
- **Storage**: >= 500GB SSD
- **Network**: 1 Gbps Ethernet

> Note the provisioning script is currently set to provision K8s with 96GB of memory. This can be adjusted as needed.

# Requirements

The following setup is required:

- **Proxmox** (@^8.3.4): This is the `HYPERVISOR` that will host LXC services and the Kubernetes cluster.
  - Should be assigned a static IP address from your router. Note, this does not need to be static externally from your home network.
  - User used to provision `LXC` is `root@pam`.
  - Access to the machine via an SSH key. SSH key should have admin permissions and be able to elevate.
