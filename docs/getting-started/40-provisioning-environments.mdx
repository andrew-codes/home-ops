# Provisioning Environments

This section provides a comprehensive guide to provisioning environments using the home-ops repository. It covers the following topics:

- Provisioning K8s
- Provisioning gitops via FluxCD
- Deploying sealed-secrets to enable secret encryption

> Note, this guide assumes you have already completed the [Prepare Hypervisor](01-prepare-hypervisor) and [Prepare DEV](02-prepare-dev) sections. If you haven't, please do so before proceeding.

> Note, this guide will provision a single environment. If you want to provision multiple environments, you will need to repeat the steps for each environment. The steps are the same for each environment, but the OnePassword vaults will be different.

## Sourcing Secrets

The required environment variable secrets needed for provisioning need to be set. You can scaffold the required secrets into an environment specific `.env` file. This file will be used to set the environment variables needed for provisioning.

```bash
# Example scaffolding for staging environment.
# This will create a file named `_.secrets.staging.provisioning.env` in the root of the repository.
# This file will contain the required environment variables for provisioning
# You will need to set the values for the environment variables in this file.
yarn nx g @ha/secrets:provisioning staging

# Once values are set, you can source the file to set the environment variables.
# The following be done for each shell session.
set -o allexport
source _.secrets.staging.provisioning.env
```

## Provision K8s Environments

These steps are performed for each environment. The steps will provision a K8s cluster and install the required components. Ensure you have sourced the environment variables for the environment you are provisioning in the shell when running these commands.

### Provision K8s Cluster

This will create a K8s cluster in Proxmox VE. The cluster will be created using kubeadm. All environments will be created with the same hardware configuration. See the `./resources/k8s/src/provision/provision.tf` file for the hardware configuration.

> Note this will automatically store the `k8s/config` secret as an ignored file in the repository. This file is required for all other commands to work. The file will be created in the `./resources/k8s/._secrets/${ENV}/.kube/config` directory. **Do not remove or commmit this file.**

```bash
yarn nx provision resource-k8s
```

You can now also set the KUBECONFIG environment variable to point to the K8s cluster. This will allow you to use kubectl commands without specifying the config file each time.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=./resources/k8s/._secrets/${ENV}/.kube/config
```

### Provision FluxCD

This will install FluxCD in the K8s cluster. FluxCD is a GitOps tool that will be used to manage deployments to the K8s cluster. The environment FluxCD directory will be created in `./clusters/${ENV}`. The configuration files will be used to deploy the applications to the K8s cluster.

```bash
yarn nx provision resource-fluxcd
```

### Provision Sealed Secrets

Sealed secrets is an FluxCD infrastructure component that will be used to encrypt secrets in the K8s cluster. The related definition files are located in `./infrastructure/sealed-secrets`.

Before proceeding, ensure the sealed-secrets controller is running in the K8s cluster. You can check the status of the controller by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods | grep sealed-secrets
```

Once sealed-secrets-controller is running, you can run the following command to save the public key to a file. This file will be used to encrypt secrets in the K8s cluster. Commit these keys to the repository.

```bash
yarn nx provision resource-sealed-secrets
```

## Sealing Secrets used by Cluster Environment

The cluster deployments depend on sealed secrets to be available in the K8s cluster. You can scaffold the required secrets into an environment specific `.env` file. This file will be located in the root of the repository.

```bash
# Example scaffolding for staging environment.
# This will create a file named `_.secrets.staging.deploying.env` in the root of the repository.
# This file will contain the required environment variables for provisioning
# You will need to set the values for the environment variables in this file.
yarn nx g @ha/secrets:deploying staging

# Once values are set or change, you can seal the secrets and commit them created files to the repository.
# Note you can re-run this command to update the secrets in the K8s cluster.
yarn nx pg @ha/secrets:seal staging
```
